# Welcome to the West Sussex JSNA Summary 2021/22

## What is the JSNA?

## What's new in the 2021/22 JSNA Summary?

Since the previous West Sussex JSNA Summary (2019/20, available here), Covid-19 has had a profound impact on health care and public health in West Sussex and beyond. Covid-19 at time of writing continues to be a global pandemic with huge implications for public health provision at all levels: locally, nationally and internationally.

In the years ahead Covid may well change the definition of public health services and what can be expected from them. This is not only because of the disease itself, but also the disruptions to other services that have occurred due to lockdowns and other interventions, and the need to provide additional services to support efforts against covid. 

As a result, this JSNA summary needs to consider that impact and act as a guide for how and where services need to react to this new world that we live in. At time of writing, it is not known whether the post-Covid world is one in which the disease is all but eliminated or whether it becomes an endemic disease that we must live with. This document aims to support commissioners of services in either eventuality. 

Previous summaries in West Sussex have focussed on the life course, broadly grouping topics according to whether they sit with children and young people (starting well), working age adults (living well) and older adults later on in life (ageing well). However, given the need for urgent action in many areas across the life course this chronological sequencing might not be the best method of arranging data. This summary attempts to define the impact of covid in various areas, categorise current impact and then presents these topics in order of urgency. The coding of topics across the life course is broadly consistent with previous summaries, as an aid to comparison across years.
